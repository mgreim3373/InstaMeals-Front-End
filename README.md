InstaMeals: Back-end

This app represents my second live project with General Assembly. It is a custom built interactive web application for storing and sharing instapot recipes. It utilizes Saas and a custom built API.

Instalation:

List of Technologies Used: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, Sass, Bootstrap, Flex Box, Heroku, Github, custom built API, Handlebars

Planning and Creation Process: This project was started with the goal of creating a single page javascript application to interact with my API using Ajax. The project began by creating wireframes and user stories to ensure that the project met requirements. I then built out the application using in HTML. The next stage of the project was to add functionality to the application using javascript, jQuery and Handlebars, and connecting it to the API using AJAX. Finally, styling was applied using a CSS.

Unsolved Issues: I plan on updating this project in the future with added styling and allowing users to search for specific recipes using keywords. I ran into some issues using bootstrap's modals. I had difficulty getting them to interact correctly with Handlebars.
